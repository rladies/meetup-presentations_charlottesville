# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
<br><br>

#### Options for recording/ reporting your analysis

- Writing code in the Console -- error prone (especially typo prone!) and hard to keep track of

- R Script + LaTeX/Word -- can be reproducible with careful organization but still error prone

- R Markdown -- code, output, prose all in one place and fully reproducible, can call R scripts as well

#### R Markdown solution

- R Markdown documents are fully **reproducible**, they can be 
automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes

- File -> New File -> R Markdown...

- Important features:
    - An (optional) YAML header surrounded by `---`
    - R code chunks surrounded by ` ``` `
    - Text mixed with simple markdown formatting
        - Human readable! (in RStudio -> Help -> Markdown Quick Reference)
        - Limited, so not too time consuming to master
    - Self contained workspace

### R Markdown installation
If you have not yet done so:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown)
```

### YAML Header
```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "R-Ladies RMarkdown Tutorial"
author: "Brigitte Hogan"
date: "8/26/2019"
output: html_document
---
```
<br><br>

***

### Output options

- HTML - web ready

- PDF - **requires TeX to be installed!**

- Word - can be useful if collaborators are Word users, but their changes cannot be easily integrated

- Many others

#### PDF Output

If you don't already have LaTeX installed, use TinyTex:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex") 
tinytex::install_tinytex() # install TinyTeX
```

Include `output: pdf_document` in the YAML header
<br><br>

***

### Using R Code

#### Two options:

- Code chunks

- Inline code

#### Code chunks

- Inserting a new code chunk:
    + keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)
    + the Insert command in the editor toolbar (see other languages as well)
    + typing the chunk delimiters (\`\`\`{r} to start, \`\`\` to end)

- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#### Chunk Options

Chunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the {} of a chunk header.

Examples:

- `include = FALSE`: code runs and results be used by other chunks, but doesn't appear in finished file
- `echo = FALSE`:  prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file (useful way to embed figures)
- `message = FALSE`: messages do not appear in the finished file
- `warning = FALSE`: warnings do not appear in the finished file
- `fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to graphical results

See [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for all options.

#### Inline code

Code results can be inserted directly into the text of a .Rmd file by enclosing the code with \` r\`
<br><br>

***

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### Figure options

- `fig_width` and `fig_height` control default figure width and height

- `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions (default = FALSE)

- `dev` controls graphics device used to render figure (default = pdf)

### Using Other Languages

#### View All Options
```{r}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```


### Python

If you don't already have reticulate installed:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("reticulate") 
library(reticulate) # load python engine
```

**Python example:**
```{python}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```

#### Passing code

Language Engines

* The R session is independent from other language sessions within RMarkdown
* Most engines will execute each code chunk in a separate new session
* For most languages, objects created in memory in a previous code chunk will not be directly available to latter code chunks
* **Exceptions:** r, python, and julia
    + all r code chunks are executed in the same R session
    + all python code chunks are executed in the same Python session, etc
    + the R session and the Python session are still independent

Passing Code (Python)

* Values can be passed to or retrieved from the Python session
* To pass a value to Python, assign to `py$name`, where name is the variable name you want to use in the Python session
* To retrieve a value from Python, also use `py$name`.


**A normal R code chunk**

```{r}
library(reticulate)
x = 42
print(x)
```

**Modify an R variable**

In the following chunk, the value of `x` on the right hand side
is `r x`, which was defined in the previous chunk.

```{r}
x = x + 12
print(x)
```

**A Python chunk**

This works fine and as expected. 

```{python}
x = 42 * 2
print(x) 
```

The value of `x` in the Python session is `r py$x`.
It is not the same `x` as the one in R.

**Modify a Python variable**

```{python}
x = x + 18 
print(x)
```

Retrieve the value of `x` from the Python session within an r chunk:

```{r}
py$x
```

Assign to a variable in the Python session from R:

```{r}
py$y = 1:5
```

See the value of `y` in the Python session:

```{python}
print(y)
```
<br><br>

#### Python graphics

You can draw plots using the **matplotlib** package in Python.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([0, 2, 1, 4])
plt.show()
```
